    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        The solution was designed to be as straightforward as possible. Tere's no logging, no persistence, nothing fancy at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to have RabbitMQ installed. Also, add a virtual host called shipabox.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that's pretty much it!
    </p>
    <p>
        FYI: There is no persistence here except what RabbitMQ provides.
        Also, there's no fault tolerance other than what's build into the frameworks in use.
